# Markdown Editor And Previewer

I am a big fan of Markdown. It is a plain text formatting syntax and software tool, originally created by John Gruber, which converts plain text to HTML. Here is a cool, minimalist Markdown editor to edit and preview markdown on the go. Even this documentation was written in markdown.

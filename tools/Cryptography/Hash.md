# Hash Generator
SHA-1 and SHA-2 are cryptographic hash functions designed by the National Security Agency (NSA). The name stands for Secure Hash Algorithm, and these are the most widely used hash functions in the world. Here, we create hashes quickly and easily right in the browser. We only support SHA256 and SHA512 for now.

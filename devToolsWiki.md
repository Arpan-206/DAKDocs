# DevTools Wiki
This page is a collection of tools and frameworks that are popular in the Software Development world. Some of them are tools, some of them are frameworks, but all can help you create an application environment. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it's up to you to decide which is best for your experience level and/or project type. I just provide you with a brief overview and point you to where you can master it.

## API
I made an API To CRUD data about the various tools and frameworks. The API is available over [here](https://devwiki.deta.dev/). If you want to just try out the API you can go to the API docs over [here](https://devwiki.deta.dev/redoc).

## The Wiki Page
The Wiki Page just takes data from the API and renders out a minimalist page for you to use.
